//    Priority Queue
//    CPU Scheduling: Priority queues are used in operating systems to manage tasks based on priority.
//    For example, higher-priority tasks are executed before lower-priority tasks in process scheduling.


//   Dijkstra's Algorithm:Used in shortest path algorithms in networking and
//   graph-related problems where the next node to visit is selected based on
//   minimum weight.

//    Event-Driven Simulations:Simulations like traffic flow, manufacturing processes,
//    or gaming often use priority queues to process events in chronological order.
//    Data Compression (Huffman Coding):
//
//    Priority queues are used to build Huffman Trees by always selecting the least frequent characters for merging.
//    Task Scheduling in Cloud Computing:
//
//    Cloud platforms utilize priority queues to allocate resources efficiently by prioritizing high-importance tasks.
//    Deque (Double-Ended Queue)
//    Undo/Redo Functionality in Text Editors:
//
//    Deques allow adding or removing edits from both ends, making them ideal for managing undo and redo operations.
//    Browser History Navigation:
//
//    Forward and backward navigation in browsers can be implemented using a deque to manage the history stack.
//    Sliding Window Problems:
//
//    Deques are efficient in solving problems like finding the maximum or minimum in a sliding window of an array.
//    Cache Implementation:
//
//    Least Recently Used (LRU) cache can be implemented using a deque to add and remove elements based on usage.
//    Deque-Based Palindrome Checker:
//
//    Deques are used to check if a string is a palindrome by comparing elements from both ends.
//            Linked List
//    Dynamic Memory Allocation:
//
//    Linked lists are used in dynamic memory allocators to manage free and allocated memory blocks.
//    Implementation of Stacks and Queues:
//
//    Linked lists provide the underlying structure for dynamic stacks and queues.
//    File Systems:
//
//    Many file systems use linked lists to manage directories or file blocks.
//    Social Media Networks:
//
//    Linked lists can represent connections or followers in social media platforms where each user points to their connections.
//    Music Playlist Applications:
//
//    Playlists often use linked lists to manage the order of songs, allowing for easy addition, deletion, or reordering of tracks.
